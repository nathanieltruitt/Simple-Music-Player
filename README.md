# SimpleMusicPlayer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

## Introduction

This is a simple music player app built to demonstrate CRUD inside of an angular frontend application. Currently the app uses a token generated from spotify. I will be integrating a small express backend for authenticating without needing to go get a new spotify token every hour later ðŸ™‚.
